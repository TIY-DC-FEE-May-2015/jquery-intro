					Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati. The Love Boat soon will be making another run. The Love Boat promises something for everyone. So lets make the most of this beautiful day. Since we're together Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati.</p>

				Love exciting and new. Come aboard were expecting you. Love life's sweetest reward Let it flow it floats back to you. As long as we live its you and me baby. There ain't nothin' wrong with that. Fish don't fry in the kitchen and beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up that hill! Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed - a poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed. They're creepy and they're kooky mysterious and spooky.</p>

				They're all together ooky the Addams Family. So get a witch's shawl on a broomstick you can crawl on. Were gonna pay a call on the Addams Family. And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew. You would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say thank you for being a friend! No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe it's primitive as can be? And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder flying there-under under the sea.</p>
